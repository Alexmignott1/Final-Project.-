Hangman Game Manual
 In this game, you will be given a word to guess. To make this game easier I have selected dorms at Lawrence university.  You must try to guess these Droms by inputting letters one at a time. If you guess the word correctly before the tries are completed, you win; otherwise, you lose.
The game starts by selecting a random word from a bank of predefined dorms at Lawrence University you will have to find that out!
The player is given a certain number of guesses to try to guess the word i set it to 6 but this can change. 
For each guess, the player is prompted to input a letter. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in the word; if not, the player loses a guess.
The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.
Once the game is over, the player is shown the final result (whether they won or lost) and the word they were trying to guess.
Guessing a Letter
To guess a letter, input a single letter (either uppercase or lowercase) and press Enter. The game will tell you if the letter you guessed is in the word or not. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word; if not, you will lose one guess.
Winning or Losing the Game
The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses. If you guess the word correctly, you win! You will be show
Playing Again
If you would like to play again, simply run the Java program again. A new random word will be selected, and you can try to guess it again. Good luck!
